# PyCAS
A computer algebra system (CAS) based on a rule-based term rewriting system
(TRS).

## Progress
Current functionality covers Real arithmetics well. Also, variables, vectors
and matrices are slowly gaining support.

## Issues
- TODO: general rules?
- TODO: more Real rules
- TODO: elaborate Number classes, Rational, Real, Complex
- TODO: complex rules, vector rules, rational
