# PyCAS
A computer algebra system (CAS) based on a rule-based term rewriting system
(TRS).

## Progress
Current functionality covers Integer arithmetics only. We're still doing the
basics here.

## Issues
- TODO: general rules?
- TODO: elaborate Number classes, Rational, Real, Complex
- TODO: create new node types, vector, matrix, functions
