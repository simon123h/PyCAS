# PyCAS
A computer algebra system (CAS) based on a rule-based term rewriting system
(TRS).

## Progress
Current functionality covers Integer arithmetics only. We're still doing the
basics here.

## Issues
- TODO: arithmetic rules
- TODO: general rules?
- TODO: InfinityRules
- TODO: elaborate Number classes, Rational, Real, Complex
- TODO: create new node types, vector, matrix, functions
- TODO: undefined Atom (e.g 0/0)
- TODO: for Infinity and undefined, save what caused it?
- TODO: str output with correct parentheses
